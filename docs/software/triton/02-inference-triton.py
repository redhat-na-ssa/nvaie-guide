# 
# A simple request to the Triton Inference Server using the REST API.
# This script sends a request to the Triton Inference Server to make a prediction
# using a linear regression model. The model is expected to be running on the server.
# The script checks if the HOST environment variable is set, and if not, it exits.
# It also checks if the model is available on the server and sends a request to make a prediction.
# The response is logged, and if there is an error, it is also logged.
# The script uses the requests library to send the request and handle the response.
# The script is designed to be run as a standalone program.

> https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/mig-ocp.html

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To demonstrate MIG, a [p4d.24xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) will be provisioned.
> This VM has 8 x A100 GPUs and AWS does not offer a smaller VM size with these GPUs.
> Please be sure to delete the MIG machines once you are done to save on cost!

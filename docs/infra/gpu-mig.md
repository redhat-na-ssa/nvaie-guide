# (Optional) Multi-Instance GPU

This section is optional if you want to explore how MIG works. The MIG machines you create in this section **will not** be used anywhere else in this guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To demonstrate MIG, a [p4d.24xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) will be provisioned.
> This VM has 8 x A100 GPUs and AWS does not offer a smaller VM size with these GPUs.
> Please be sure to delete the MIG machines once you are done to save on cost!
